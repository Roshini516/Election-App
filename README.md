Project Overview:-

The State Assembly Election Portal is a simple digital platform designed to help manage and conduct state elections online.
This version focuses only on the frontend part, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The idea is to make the voting process more transparent, secure, and easy to use — both for voters and administrators.





Features in This Version :-

Home Page:
Includes an overview of the platform, information about the Election Commission, and some beginner guidelines on how to use the site.
It also highlights the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM) and shows sections for present, past, and upcoming elections.

Navigation Bar:
Lets users switch between pages easily — Home, Voter Login, Admin Login, and Registration.

Voter Login Page:
A basic form where a voter can log in using Voter ID and password (not connected to backend yet).

Admin Login Page:
Separate login section for admin users to manage the system.

Registration Page:
Simple form to register a new voter with name, voter ID, email, and password.

Voting Page :
A sample page showing how a digital voting screen could look, with mock candidate options.

Future Plans :-

Connect to a Database:
Use Node.js with MySQL or MongoDB to save and verify voter and admin details.

Authentication & Security:
Add encrypted login sessions and secure password storage.

Real Voting Logic:
Build a working voting mechanism that records and counts votes in real time.

Admin Dashboard:
Create a dashboard for admins to view live stats, manage users, and monitor elections.

API Development:
Build REST APIs for data exchange between the frontend and backend.

Blockchain Option (Future Scope):
For added transparency and tamper-proof vote records.
